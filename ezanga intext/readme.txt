	= DEFINITIONS =

	- MAXIMUM ADVERTISEMENTS PER PAGE: This limits the maximum number of InText advertisements that will 
		 be shown on any individual web page.
        - CONTENT CLASSES: Content classes tell our keyword parser where to look for content on your web page. 
                 Enter the CSS class name of the element(s), or parent element(s), where you don't want to place 
                 InText advertisements. The class name: "entry-content" is the default class that Wordpress 
                 uses to define an article. Use commas to separate your classes. Only valid class names are 
		 allowed.
        - STOP CLASSES: If InText advertisements are being displayed in an undesired area, such as a comments 
                 section, stop classes will tell our keyword parser where you don't want advertisements to 
                 be rendered. Enter the CSS class name of the element(s), or parent element(s), you would like to 
		 ignore. Use commas to separate your classes. Only valid class names are allowed.
        -STOP WORDS: If our keyword parser is returning words or phrases that you do not want in your results, 
                 add stop words to exclude keywords from the results. Use commas to separate your words.


7) Once you have filled out the form to your satisfaction click 'Save InText Options.'

8) InText advertisements will now be displayed on your WordPress website. If ads do not display on your page,
